The Internet fulfilled the promise embodied in Sun Microsystems’ slogan &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Network_is_the_Computer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Network is the Computer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By interconnecting individual computers, the Internet enabled its users to communicate without limits and without worrying about borders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This unrestricted interconnection emerged at a pivotal moment in modern history: the opposition between the West and the Eastern Bloc led by the USSR had—albeit temporarily, as we now know—faded away, China was becoming the world’s factory, and the movement and collaboration between were much freer and open than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Internet supported a kind of utopia of instant communication and sharing, previously unknown. This utopia was made possible by a set of open and standardized protocols. This was the key to enabling all kinds of different systems to cooperate and communicate seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were, of course, isolationist or monopolistic temptations from certain manufacturers or software editors. But open and standardized protocols ultimately prevailed, enabling unprecedented expansion. Built on top of TCP/IP, UDP, and DNS, among others, the HTTP and HTML duo would propel the Web as the Internet’s preferred communication platform for the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;limited-use-of-encryption&#34;&gt;Limited Use of Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The success of this communication utopia was achieved without much concern for ensuring authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, less than 30% of websites used encryption. The consequences of this negligence in addressing security risks were confirmed by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013: our data was exposed to anyone who wanted and could intercept and collect it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-encrypt-is-coming&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is coming&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birth-of-an-automated-and-free-certificate-authority&#34;&gt;The Birth of an Automated and Free Certificate Authority&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the main obstacles to the widespread adoption of encryption, &lt;a href=&#34;https://insufficient.coffee/about/&#34;&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/a&gt;, one of the architects of Let’s Encrypt and now a Site Reliability Engineer after leading Firefox’s cryptographic team, responds:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jc-jones100.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;More and more information was flowing across the Web, and most data being transferred did not have integrity or confidential protections from TLS. The biggest stumbling block to using TLS everywhere was obtaining and managing server-side certificates, and so: Let’s Encrypt&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;  &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obtaining a certificate was the main obstacle, and this was the priority to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This view was shared by a group of partners who, starting in 2014, pooled resources to establish Let’s Encrypt, an automated and free certificate authority. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-gran-saline/&#34;&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Communications at Let’s Encrypt, shares:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/sarah-gran100.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Early collaborators included people from Mozilla, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt was born.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Web ecosystem, certificate authorities are organizations from which you can obtain a certificate for a domain  after proving you control it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is since 2015 a certificate authority that delivers for free (as in free beer) TLS Server certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the legal/administrative side, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificate authority operates for the public’s benefit and is a service provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), a California public benefit corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt results&lt;/a&gt; ten years after its birth, they are really impressive and as Sarah Gran points out, so is the global HTTPS usage:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our stated mission from day one was to get the web to 100% encryption. When we started issuance, only about 39% of website visits were HTTPS. Today, it’s nearly 95% in the United States, and over 83% globally. We still have work to do, but we are proud of the progress we’ve made over the last ten years&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt delivers certificates in a automated manner using the ACME protocol which implies no manual action from the site owner nor the certificate authority. So, let&amp;rsquo;s speak now a little about the automation aspect!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;automation-the-core-of-the-operation&#34;&gt;Automation: The Core of the Operation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the mid-2020s perspective, the automation at the heart of Let’s Encrypt might seem obvious, but in the first half of the 2010s, it was far from the norm. The ecosystem of public certificate authorities issuing server certificates was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, automation appears to be there to help website managers reliably deploy the TLS protocol on their sites, but it was first and foremost an absolute prerequisite for the very viability of the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://aarongable.com/#about&#34;&gt;Aaron Gable&lt;/a&gt;, tech lead of Boulder—the software at the core of Let’s Encrypt—, confirms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/aaron-gable100.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Automation was always going to be critical to Let’s Encrypt’s success. From the very beginning, we knew that there was no way we could scale manual validation on a non-profit’s budget&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Aaron Gable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is worth noting that Let’s Encrypt has operated on an Internet scale from the start with a small team of about fifteen engineers, or even fewer at launch. For this team, automation was the only viable way to fulfill the immense mission they had set for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;acme&#34;&gt;ACME&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-open-and-automated-protocol-that-powers-lets-encrypt&#34;&gt;The Open and automated Protocol That Powers Let’s Encrypt&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about automation in relation to Let’s Encrypt, we are talking about ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This protocol allows client software to prove to an ACME-compatible certificate authority that it controls the domain for which it is requesting a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Gran clarifies an important point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;An important aspect of how Let’s Encrypt works is that we verify control over a domain, not ownership&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Control vs. ownership of a domain—a nuance everyone should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This proof of control involves the client responding to a challenge issued by the ACME-compatible certificate authority. The challenge can be an HTTP, DNS, or TLS challenge, depending on the client’s choice and certificate authority support. Completing the challenge requires the ACME client to place a value provided by the ACME server—in a standardized HTTP path, a DNS zone, or a TLS response, respectively. All of these operations are cryptographically verified, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key point is that this entire dialogue between the client and the ACME server is executed without any human intervention, enabling the automatic issuance of certificates. Their deployment and integration into the web service can also generally be automated using scripts triggered after issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;birth-of-acme&#34;&gt;Birth of ACME&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One might wonder whether ACME was part of Let’s Encrypt’s design from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;J.C. Jones confirms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;By late 2014, the idea of an HTTP REST API with &amp;ldquo;/challenge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;/certificate&amp;rdquo; existed, but we hadn’t defined much beyond that. We had a series of in-person meetings, in the Mozilla San Francisco office on Embarcadero and the EFF office in the Tenderloin through the spring of 2015 where we worked out the details&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ACME was indeed at the core of Let’s Encrypt from the start and underwent a refinement process to cover all use cases as thoroughly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;securing-the-web-or-the-internet&#34;&gt;Securing the Web or the Internet?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of use cases, one might wonder whether the Web was Let’s Encrypt’s primary target, or if securing the Internet with its multiple protocols was also part of the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Gran provides an unambiguous first-level answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our stated mission from day one was to get the web to 100% encryption. When we started issuance, only about 39% of website visits were HTTPS. Today, it’s nearly 95% in the United States, and over 83% globally. We still have work to do, but we are proud of the progress we’ve made over the last ten years&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when asked about the various types of challenges in the protocol, J.C. Jones offers a nuance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;DNS, TLS-SNI, and HTTP were all in planning in spring 2015, but many of us were less confident in the procedure around the DNS validation. Which is ironic, as it turned out TLS-SNI had a vulnerability so we had to stop using it and our DNS validation was ultimately fine. In general, the collection of us were simply respectful of the great complexity within the DNS&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a perspective not often publicly expressed by engineers primarily from the Web: their lack of confidence in implementing a DNS challenge stemmed from their humility regarding the complexity of the DNS ecosystem and the level of expertise required to master it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The challenge was ultimately met, and this DNS challenge—though not its primary purpose—enabled multiple protocols outside HTTP like SMTP to be secured by ACME.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;standardization-and-open-source&#34;&gt;Standardization and Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;developed-in-the-open&#34;&gt;Developed in the Open&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ACME was documented openly from the start, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://certbot.eff.org/&#34;&gt;Certbot&lt;/a&gt;, the first open-source ACME client co-developed with the EFF, served as the reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a standardization process through the IETF resulted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/&#34;&gt;RFC 8555&lt;/a&gt; in March, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences developing an open and standardized protocol was the creation of a multitude of &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/&#34;&gt;ACME clients covering a very wide range of use cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;J.C. Jones confirms that this was the goal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is what we foresaw, or at least hoped for. The initial client development often had conversations like, ‘oh, if someone wants that, then they’ll write their own client.’ It was a key part of why the REST API needed to be an IETF standard, and was part of the argument at the IETF BoF that resulted in the formation of the ACME Working Group in Q3 2015&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt has always provided constant support to developers by responding in its forum or on its GitHub issue tracker, and all this work has truly paid off. &lt;a href=&#34;https://letsencrypt.org/2025/10/07/ten-yrs-community-forum&#34;&gt;An interesting post&lt;/a&gt; has been recently written about this topic on Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;standardization-for-what-benefits&#34;&gt;Standardization for what benefits?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other question that can be asked is whether or not the standardization process within the IETF has led to an improvement in the ACME protocol thanks to the cooperation that guides this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/about/staff/jacob-hoffman-andrews&#34;&gt;Jacob Hoffman-Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8555/&#34;&gt;RFC 8555&lt;/a&gt; authors working for EFF &amp;amp; Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, confirms an initial benefit that the ACME protocol has been able to derive from its standardization process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/jacob100.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the big changes was from a validation-first flow to a certificate-request-first flow. In other words, earlier drafts had subscribers requesting validation for domain names and then requesting a certificate once those validations were successful. The final RFC has subscribers request a certificate, and then the CA tells the subscriber what validations are needed. This change originated from within the IETF discussion process, and was intended to make handling of wildcard certificates more natural.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Jacob Hoffman-Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside this first design improvement, Jacob details a second major improvement of the security of the protocol, improvement that also landed during the IETF standardization process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another big change, also originated from within the IETF, was to make all requests authenticated, including GET requests. Since ACME is authenticated with signed POSTs, this necessitated the POST-as-GET concept that’s in ACME today&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Jacob Hoffman-Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can see there how IETF iterations can challenge the Security of a protocol and leads its development to innovative solutions to tackle the challenge it faces!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last, Jacob adds another information that illustrates the benefits of developing a protocol into the open: it allows the community to challenge (and sometimes, fix) its Security level due to the availability of all materials and often, of the  reference implementation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another very important evolution was the deprecation of the tls-sni-01 challenge method. This was found to be flawed by Frans Rosen, a security researcher. It was replaced with TLS-ALPN-01, developed at IETF with significant input from Google&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Jacob Hoffman-Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-encrypt-acme-and-the-public-certificate-authorities-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Let’s Encrypt, ACME, and the Public Certificate Authorities Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the arrival of Let’s Encrypt in the public certificate authorities ecosystem raised a number of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What level of cooperation or hostility? What impact on the viability of existing certificate authorities?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here again, the fact that Let’s Encrypt was based on an open protocol, immediately subject to an IETF standardization initiative, enabled collaboration and adoption by the most innovative certificate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;J.C. Jones confirms this, discussing the External Account Binding (EAB) option of the protocol which is a way for an ACME client to authenticate to the server using an identifier and a key value which are verifiable by the server in repository he maintains:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;EAB was an early addition at the IETF ACME Working Group. Many in the room were worried that without a means to bind to a payment method, ACME would not get adoption. In fact, some of the counterarguments to forming ACME were blunted by EAB, as such a mechanism wasn’t in the theoretically-competing, already-existent standard: SCEP. SCEP, it was argued, already handled &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; certificate issuance, for private certificate authorities. Anything else needed a feasible path for usage payment.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond billing, the addition of EAB allowed also existing certificate authorities to integrate their existing domain control validation systems with ACME.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The IETF standardization process, based on an open process, created the necessary discussion space for cooperation among entities that did not necessarily share the same objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result, ten years after the introduction of ACME and the completion of its standardization process in 2019, is that ACME has become the primary means by which all public certificate authorities—both free and commercial—rely on for their transition to an automated future of issuing short-lived certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively, until march 2026, the maximum lifespan of a public TLS server certificate has been set to 398 days by the CA/B Forum, the organization that set the rules for public certificate authorities. After the vote of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cabforum.org/2025/04/11/ballot-sc081v3-introduce-schedule-of-reducing-validity-and-data-reuse-periods/&#34;&gt;ballot SC081&lt;/a&gt; at the CA/B Forum, the certificate lifespan will decrease gradually to reach 47 days in March 2029. And the automation provided by ACME seems to be one of the main identified levers to help organizations to adapt to this drastic reduction in the lifespan of public TLS server certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;created-at-lets-encrypt-adopted-everywhere&#34;&gt;Created at Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, adopted everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that although ACME was developed by the team managing Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt, this protocol is now one of the main protocols for automated certificate acquisition adopted by all public certificate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And outside the public certificate authorities ecosystem, I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that this protocol is also becoming increasingly popular with technical architects in companies with private certificate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been the case in my company for several years now, where we have deployed an ACME endpoint in front of our internal certificate authority. Among the benefits we have seen, we have been able to rely on the vast ACME clients ecosystem in order to provide an ACME client to each OS or middleware that powers our infrastructure. We can see there how certificate obtention agility powered by ACME helps organizations in their journey to global IT agility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-and-the-adoption-challenge&#34;&gt;Innovation and the adoption challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ari-episode&#34;&gt;The ARI episode&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We may fear that the development of a protocol supported primarily by a team as small as Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s will be fairly limited in terms of evolution and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the history of ACME shows that its evolution continues after its initial standardization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, we saw with the ARI (ACME Renewal Information &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9773.html&#34;&gt;RFC 9773&lt;/a&gt;) extension that the ACME protocol continues to evolve. ARI is a way for a certificate authority to suggest a renewal period to its clients, often earlier than they would have determined themselves. This use case is particularly relevant when the certificate authority needs to mass-revoke certificates that, for example, did not comply with the rules the certificate authority must follow when issuing certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, J.C. Jones and Aaron Gable point two incidents that had to be handled by the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt team and that were the start for the ARI initiative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Explicitly, as remediation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179&#34;&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619179&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672&#34;&gt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1715672&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones and Aaron Gabble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;support-to-encourage-adoption&#34;&gt;Support to encourage adoption&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Gable leads the effort of designing and implementing ARI. But even if a new extension to the protocol has been produced, it can only reach its potential users after ACME clients have implemented it into their code base. As previously said, the team and some community members invest a lot on providing support to the community. In the case of ARI, this support is oriented to the ACME clients developers in order to make these clients ARI aware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Providing an efficient support and effective resources to the client side ACME actors is a huge part of the challenge in order to keep ACME ecosystem healthy and agile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As illustrates by Sarah Gran, another way to give momentum to a new feature is to lift certain restrictions on access to the certificate authority:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to encourage ARI adoption, we’ve configured Let’s Esement Prématuré : Je dois signaler que la bâche fournie (qui était noire au départ) a rapidement pris une teinte grise à cause du soleil.&#xA;• Fragilité : De plus, elle a tendance à se déchirer facilement.ncrypt to allow subscribers who renew via ARI to bypass our rate limits.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But despite a good support work and incentive measures, Aaron Gable confirms ARI adoption is just at its start:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is still much progress to be made. Part of the appeal of the Automated Certificate Management Environment is that many users can set-and-forget their client and configuration. This means that most clients never receive software updates, and even client projects that have implemented ARI in their latest version still have massive install bases that aren’t running that version. We’ve worked closely with many clients developers to implement ARI, and contributed implementations ourselves in several cases, but for widespread adoption the whole ecosystem will need to slowly turn over&amp;quot; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Aaron Gable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation is really shared with a lot of client side softwares that &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;(c)&lt;/em&gt; and it raises some concerns about how to make an ecosystem keeping track with innovation on its client side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolution-on-server-side-acme-implementation&#34;&gt;Evolution on server side ACME implementation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CA/B Forum has recently asked public certificate authorities to adopt &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2024/07/05/a-brief-history-of-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration/&#34;&gt;Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration&lt;/a&gt; (MPIC) to guard against BGP attacks. We have asked Aaron Gable about the impacts that kind of measure have had on ACME server side implementation in the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We’ve had to make few if any changes to our infrastructure to accommodate recent requirements changes such as MPIC and DNSSEC validation. We innovated MPIC (then called Remote Validation) along with a research team at Princeton, and implemented it in 2020. Our experience already running such a service helped inform the requirements as they were incorporated by the CA/B Forum.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Aaron Gable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lesson learnt here is that being at the edge of the innovation let you shape part of the future of your ecosystem and significantly lower the impact on your infrastructure of many regulatory measures that come into effect over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;future&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is really encouraging to see a lot of innovation in the ACME ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what evolutions can we expect to see in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have asked the question to Aaron Gable who gave us two upcoming developments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We’re currently working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-profiles/&#34;&gt;standardizing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;profile selection for ACME&lt;/strong&gt;, and our deployment of the early draft of this standard has already brought some much-needed flexibility to the WebPKI, enabling us to make changes to our certificate contents with minimal disruption.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I’m also excited about a potential future change which would &lt;strong&gt;introduce a &amp;lsquo;pubkey&amp;rsquo; identifier type&lt;/strong&gt;, along with a set of challenges that allow the client to demonstrate control over the corresponding keypair. This would fix the gap today that presenting a CSR does not actually prove possession of the key in that CSR.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Araron Gable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we can venture to say that ACME&amp;rsquo;s future looks bright 😊&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another recent development based on ACME has also shed new light on the potential of this protocol: since 2022, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-acme-device-attest/&#34;&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; is under progress at the IETF in order to write an ACME extension. The goal of this extension is to use ACME to obtain a certificate for a device in order to prove its identity. The challenge is based on device attestation and what&amp;rsquo;s new in this case is the arrival of a third party, the attestation server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is remarkable here is that we are no longer dealing with ACME&amp;rsquo;s initial use case, namely obtaining TLS server certificates: we can see in this IETF draft the potential of ACME as a challenge-based framework to obtain certificate in very different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is heartening to see that, 30 years after the widespread adoption of the Internet, open and standardized protocols continue to revolutionize its use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ACME and its Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt implementation at scale have enabled the widespread adoption of HTTPS, thereby raising the level of security for billions of Internet users and also of private networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having been able to do it inside a non profit organization, providing the Internet with an open and standardized protocol is a great success for all people believing in FreeSoftware and an Open Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a community, I really think we can thank these organizations, teams, and engineers who continue to uphold the promise of efficiency and Freedom brought about by cooperation around open protocols. They inspire new generations (and older ones I guess 😉) demonstrating big things can still be achevied today in the open for the common good!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to extend a special thank you to the members of the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt team, &lt;strong&gt;J.C. Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Aaron Gable&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gran&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jacob Hoffman-Andrews&lt;/strong&gt;, for the time and effort they dedicated to answering my questions. Without them, this article would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A big shout out also to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/regit&#34;&gt;Eric Leblond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://infosec.exchange/@doegox&#34;&gt;Philippe Teuwen&lt;/a&gt; who carefully proofread this article and gave me valuable and insightful advices 🙏&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/IMG_1681.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Chilling moment during #PTS22, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Chilling moment during #PTS22, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2022 has been quite a crucial year in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pass-the-salt-org/&#34;&gt;Pass the SALT&lt;/a&gt; conference short history. We had to switch back to an in-person form of event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can seem quite obvious, but after two years of full remote conference, it has been quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As often said, &lt;strong&gt;#SharingIsCaring&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in this blogpost, I will share:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some doubts&lt;/strong&gt; I have crossed during the restart of the conference&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some thoughts about conference organization&lt;/strong&gt; after 15 years of involvement as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brocas.org/#about&#34;&gt;volunteer conference founder and organizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;reading some comments after initial blog post publication focusing mainly on the resigning idea, I want to clarify one point: I have &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; spoke about it to show that it can happen and be handled with the help your co-org team members for ex.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;IMHO (only) the second part dedicated to conference organisation decisions and goals is the most important part of the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;being-back-on-stage-after-2-year-long-pandemic&#34;&gt;Being back on stage after 2 year-long pandemic&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have organized an event once a year for more than 10 years and suddenly, the pandemic stops you and your friends during more than 2 years, &lt;strong&gt;it impacts you&lt;/strong&gt;. No more physical contact nor social interaction whereas a conference is essentially a face-to-face event. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t see or admit it, it hurts you as a social person!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, the relaunch of the event hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an easy path. One month before the #PTS22 event, I have even decided to resign just after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.pass-the-salt.org/&#34;&gt;2022 edition&lt;/a&gt;. I have shared it with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/doegox&#34;&gt;@doegox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_cryptocorn_&#34;&gt;@_cryptocorn_&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why resigning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the point of investing time and energy in events like Pass the SALT anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I doubted my own added value. I also doubted the impact that this type of event could have on the security ecosystem, on the speakers and on the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been quite frustrated all along the process of restarting the event under its in-person form:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;we had to deal with constraints due to the pandemic (ex.: how to find a &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; location for the social event?),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fewer attendees have registered and finally came,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fewer speakers were also eager to physically attend the conference&lt;/strong&gt;. I definitely understand their point of view. But it has been very frustrating on my side because meeting new speakers, make interactions happen between them and other speakers or attendees is at the core of the event.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Failing to provoke desire into some potential speakers heart has been really hard to live during this fragile moment of relaunching the event. &lt;strong&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure anymore to have the words and the vision to lead this conference&lt;/strong&gt; and convince people to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/doegox&#34;&gt;@doegox&lt;/a&gt; convinced me to postpone my decision after the event. Social interactions with speakers and attendees during the event have generated enough energy to do the magic! For the moment at least ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/jiska.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Enthusiastic speakers like Jiska are the ❤️ and the soul of the event. 🙏 to all of them! Photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA_&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Enthusiastic speakers like Jiska are the ❤️ and the soul of the event. 🙏 to all of them! Photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA_&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now, some thoughts about organizing conferences!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the record, my experience as a conference organizer comes from:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;RMLL Security track curator role from 2008 to 2017&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and Pass the SALT co-founder and co-organizer since 2018.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;one-more-conference-really&#34;&gt;One more conference, really?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite a small adjustment after the pandemic period and some conferences having stopped, we can say that IT or Security conferences are just everywhere nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Security conferences landscape stretches from local events ran by volunteers to huge commercial events in the middle of the desert. They can be specialized on a particular topic or cover all modern Security topics. Not being able to find the right one for you is quite difficult, aside the location and the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;strong&gt;your main challenge&lt;/strong&gt; before launching a new conference is to &lt;strong&gt;find a brand new angle&lt;/strong&gt;, not already covered by another conference, at least in your area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can run an event locally without any specific topic/angle aside Security. For example, a lot of BSides events follow this format. Your event will provide to the local community the opportunity to encounter seasoned speakers and do social networking. It will have an impact, no problem wih that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;your-mission-both-a-tool-and-a-responsibility&#34;&gt;Your mission, both a tool and a responsibility&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, not having a specific focus or mission will be a lack on the long-term. The event will have a harder time providing a clear vision of what it brings to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a specific mission provides you your identity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, having your own mission is a big part of your attractiveness. For potential speakers, for attendees, for the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, if you respect your mission at each step of your decision process, your mission becomes an effective tool to maintain consistency over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being consistent over time with your mission helps you build credibility for your event&lt;/strong&gt; and allows you to build trust with participants and the broader security community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a specific mission also &lt;strong&gt;brings clarity, readibility&lt;/strong&gt; to attendees, speakers and sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;as a tool, it definitely makes organizers life easier&lt;/strong&gt; when, for example, you have to choose among the talks proposals of the call for paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;advocating-for-long-term-actions&#34;&gt;Advocating for long-term actions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After speaking about your identity, let&amp;rsquo;s give a look to the footprint you might leave into the community history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My preferred way to think and act is to do things on the long-time scale. Because it forces you to be humble and to (try to) build things in a solid way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acting on the long-term has some positive impacts on conference organizing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;organizers suffer less from the instantaneous results quest&lt;/strong&gt; that modern world is asking them for ,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;organizers are pushed to &lt;strong&gt;adopt an iterative rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;these iterations secure the foundation&lt;/strong&gt; upon your event is built on and grows.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, Pass the SALT is dedicated to Free Software and Security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The values that underpin the event are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;transparency&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;freedom of access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; between individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our case, being part of the long-term and act in line with our mission therefore translates into multiple choices done through our RMLL and PTS experiences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;set up &lt;strong&gt;an event whose access is free of charge&lt;/strong&gt; for all (talks, workshops, pauses and social event included);&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ➡️ done &lt;strong&gt;since 2008&lt;/strong&gt; ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;add &lt;strong&gt;each year&lt;/strong&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://archives.pass-the-salt.org/&#34;&gt;self-hosted archive site&lt;/a&gt; all the &lt;strong&gt;slides and videos&lt;/strong&gt; produced during the current edition ; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ➡️ done &lt;strong&gt;since 2008&lt;/strong&gt; ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pass-the-salt.org/achievements/#contributions&#34;&gt;document into the open all collaborations&lt;/a&gt; we are aware of, resulting from the conference. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ➡️ done &lt;strong&gt;since 2011&lt;/strong&gt; ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work with partners on a long-term basis like we do with &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ubicast&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for talks recording. It helps a lot a very small organization like us. Ubicast records and streams all the talks, provides us the recording as well as a portal for all the videos they recorded. They have been fair enough to also host onto the portal videos we recorded on Zoom during our virtual switch due to the pandemic. 🙏 for all of this!&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; ➡️ done &lt;strong&gt;since 2018&lt;/strong&gt; (and long before for the RMLL side) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants&#34;&gt;Standing on the shoulders of giants&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But long-term actions came also from our history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/rmll2014-security-track.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Full room before attending Lunar talk about Tor during RMLL 2014, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA_&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Full room before attending Lunar talk about Tor during RMLL 2014, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA_&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our roots mainly come from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_Software_Meeting&#34;&gt;Libre Software Meeting&lt;/a&gt; (or Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre / RMLL in French).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from RMLL, Philippe has also been part of the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;BruCon&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for years, member of &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Hack.lu&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SSTIC&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; program committee. On his side, Mathieu has been a member of the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SSTIC&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; organization team for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we all have being part of the RMLL organization, mainly as Security track curators apart from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_cryptocorn_&#34;&gt;Eloïse&lt;/a&gt; who started in 2014 as an organization team member at age of 16 🤩. We have learned a lot from this organization team, from the achievements and maybe even more from the fails!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, being part of a bigger event than our small track also helped us &lt;strong&gt;to safely learn the job and try some ideas&lt;/strong&gt;: setting up an English only spoken track, see the benefits of having a speakers dinner etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to illustrate the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;learning from the fails&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; aspect, since 2003, RMLL have been held in a different town each year. As so, the local organization team changed almost entirely each year also. We have clearly identified this way of operating as a sure win to lose the expertise and the understanding of how an event works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, since we founded Pass the SALT, we paid a special attention to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the management of our small team&lt;/strong&gt; by carefully making addition to it and trying to take care of each other&amp;rsquo;s desires as much as possible ,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;document the functioning of the conference&lt;/strong&gt; for new members or simply to be able to capitalize a little more year after year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all these shared moments and so many great editions, &lt;strong&gt;hats off to the creators of RMLL&lt;/strong&gt; and org team members from 2008 to 2017! We learned a lot and Pass the SALT wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there without you 👏&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special attention:&lt;/strong&gt; this year, we have the surprise to see one of our RMLL colleagues, &lt;a href=&#34;https://2019.educode.be/intervenants/georges-khaznadar/&#34;&gt;Georges Khaznadar&lt;/a&gt;, former Education track co-curator, to be in the room at #PTS22. A very emotional moment for me and I am really sad not having been able to share a longer moment with you, Georges! Maybe during a next edition (I hope so!) ❤️🤞&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-little-extra-soul&#34;&gt;A little extra soul&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a small event, we cannot rely on the fact we would be a must-attend event. We have to prove that this event is a little special and deserves to be visited!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We created our conference with a special care to the details and as users of our own work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/program.png&#34; alt=&#34;Building a new feature: adding a foldable program to #PTS22 badge, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Building a new feature: adding a foldable program to #PTS22 badge, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, we try to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make access to the conference as easy as possible&lt;/strong&gt; for both attendees and speakers (no cost entry, no personal information collection, straight forward registration process or detailed information on website and pushed to participants mailbox) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;even if it is a zero cost event, &lt;strong&gt;set up paid pauses and social event&lt;/strong&gt; to maximize exchange times ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;put a special attention to the &lt;strong&gt;(always documented!) badge design production&lt;/strong&gt; ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;provide a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;yearly report&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; with all the figures and the detailed feedback received from speakers and attendees.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also always &lt;strong&gt;try to go to people, speak with a lot of present people, putting warmth and engagement&lt;/strong&gt; into these exchanges. We do that way because we are deeply convinced that warm and deep exchanges between event attendees are the only real added value of conferences over all other forms of content sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/sharing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sharing moments during #PTS22 speakers dinner, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sharing moments during #PTS22 speakers dinner, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This last part is quite important for me. We all organize this event to encounter people, new ones and old friends. For my part, without meetings, I would just quit the boat, as simple as that. Due to the warm feeling it produces when we regularly meet again, I used to call all the previous RMLL and PTS speakers (and regular attendees ofc), &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Family (tm)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Enough said, I guess 🫳&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/family.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fun and furious are usually “The Family“ members like Eric 😉, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Fun and furious are usually “The Family“ members like Eric 😉, photo by doegox under CC BY-NC-SA license&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of our attendees, past speaker and seasoned conference organizer qualifies us as an event with &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;a little extra soul”&lt;/em&gt; 🤩&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tomchop_&#34;&gt;@tomchop_&lt;/a&gt;, we will try not to disappoint you in the future 😘&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last, a short focus on the Virtual form and its impact on social aspect:&lt;/strong&gt; during the pandemic, we made the choice to run the event two years in a row under a virtual form. The event took the form of three afternoons in a row of talks delivered live by the speakers. Our feedback on that way of running is that finally, we have lost what really matters: speaking with speakers after talks, real human exchanges during breaks and social events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are almost sure that we would not do the event remotely again if it would not be possible to run it on-site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;summer&#34;&gt;Summer&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to our history (RMLL we are looking at you!), our conference has always been held during the first days of July.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use to run the conference organization with my friends and then, I usually disappear (almost) for 2 or 3 weeks somewhere right after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/nowhere.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Calm and reloading in the middle of nowhere, photo by /me under CC BY-NC-SA license&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Calm and reloading in the middle of nowhere, photo by /me under CC BY-NC-SA license&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a way to come down softly after the rush of emotions generated by the conference and its participants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have participated to this kind of event as an organizer or even an attendee, it may be like going to an intense festival. It takes time to digest all the emotions and ideas you have felt or crossed during these few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This after-event period is a very profitable moment for me to try to transform all these emotions and ideas into new directions for the next iteration of the conference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/redlines.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sat in front of Red Lines installation by Evan Roth, Rencontres d&amp;amp;rsquo;Arles 2022, photo by F.B.(c)&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sat in front of Red Lines installation by Evan Roth, Rencontres d&amp;amp;rsquo;Arles 2022, photo by F.B.(c)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer is also the time of Music and Photography festivals&lt;/strong&gt;. I always try to participate to these kind of event. I also try to find and read interviews of festival organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, give a try to this &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Sam Stourdzé interview&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; [fr], former director of the Rencontres d&amp;rsquo;Arles, the main French photography festival.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is such a rich source of inspiration despite the differences between the events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among other topics, Sam Stourdzé explains during this interview that the soul of an event mainly comes from of what happens besides the event, during moments of exchanges. He also advocates that the atmosphere coming from the different locations used to host the event gives a little extra soul to it. I can&amp;rsquo;t agree more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you can see, all of these inspiration sources provide you a lot of new perspectives and ideas you can try to adapt to your own event to improve it&lt;/strong&gt; 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;last-word&#34;&gt;Last word&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/sharing-thoughts/toyou.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;It&amp;amp;rsquo;s your turn to share your experiences 🫵, photo by Xavier Mertens under CC BY-NC-SA license&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;It&amp;amp;rsquo;s your turn to share your experiences 🫵, photo by Xavier Mertens under CC BY-NC-SA license&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I finally came to the end of this quite (too?) long article. I hope you enjoyed the ride and, of course, feel free to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;come back to me&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to exchange about these topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, &lt;strong&gt;I would really appreciate to read feedback coming from other conferences organizers&lt;/strong&gt; to learn from each other&amp;rsquo;s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/rea.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ce court témoignage est là pour expliquer notre vécu au sein du &lt;strong&gt;service de réanimation de l&amp;rsquo;hôpital Saint André de Bordeaux&lt;/strong&gt;. Et pour dire merci à &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; les soignants de ce service. &lt;strong&gt;Vraiment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;quand-la-vie-bascule&#34;&gt;Quand la vie bascule&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mi février 2021 : suite à un appel au 15 pour un  de nos proches après une angine qui semble dégénérer, le médecin régulateur décide de l&amp;rsquo;envoyer au service des urgences du CHU de Bordeaux. Ce dernier le renvoie après un premier diagnostic en soins intensifs à l&amp;rsquo;hôpital Saint André de Bordeaux.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic consolidé : une maladie &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inserm.fr/information-en-sante/dossiers-information/maladies-auto-immunes&#34;&gt;auto-immune&lt;/a&gt; foudroie notre proche. Après une première explication d&amp;rsquo;une doctoresse, la gravité de la situation nous saisit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vont se succéder alors 8 semaines de réanimation avec une forme atypique et très douloureuse de sa maladie, des comas provoqués pour &amp;ldquo;gérer&amp;rdquo; ses douleurs insoutenables, une perte d&amp;rsquo;autonomie et de communication quasi totale et un pronostic de récupération des plus incertains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;L&amp;rsquo;enfer est là, présent et constant. Pour le patient. Pour nous. Pour l&amp;rsquo;équipe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;pouvoir-venir-voir-notre-proche-en-réanimation&#34;&gt;Pouvoir venir voir notre proche en réanimation.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons pu voir quotidiennement notre proche en réanimation. Une personne par jour. Nous avons alterner, un jour sur deux. Et ce malgré la présence de patients COVID occupant la quasi totalité des chambres du service.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Un premier remerciement à l&amp;rsquo;équipe de s&amp;rsquo;être organisée ainsi car on n&amp;rsquo;ose pas imaginer comment notre proche aurait pu (sur)vivre (à) sa maladie coupé de sa famille alors que déjà, sa maladie l&amp;rsquo;étouffait et le privait de tout lien avec l&amp;rsquo;extérieur. Cela a compté. &lt;strong&gt;Vraiment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;réaction-déquipe-avec-humilité-et-persévérance&#34;&gt;Réaction d&amp;rsquo;équipe, avec humilité et persévérance.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le caractère atypique de sa maladie a fait que les traitements décidés par l&amp;rsquo;équipe médicale n&amp;rsquo;ont &lt;em&gt;pas toujours&lt;/em&gt; répondu comme attendu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notre proche a souffert de douleurs insoutenables qui ont obligé les docteurs à le plonger plusieurs fois en sédation profonde.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;L&amp;rsquo;équipe a douté, a rechallengé ses diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et pourtant, jamais nous n&amp;rsquo;avons eu le sentiment que l&amp;rsquo;équipe se désagrégeait, que des indivualités se désolidarisaient du reste des professionnels qui nous entouraient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A chaque fois, les docteurs, quels qu&amp;rsquo;ils soient, nous ont répondu de manière factuelle, avec des explications sur où ils voulaient aller, pourquoi ils y allaient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;De même, quand ils ne savaient pas ce qui se passait, qu&amp;rsquo;un traitement ne donnait pas les résultats attendus, qu&amp;rsquo;un acte ne se passait pas comme prévu, l&amp;rsquo;équipe médicale nous le disait en toute &lt;strong&gt;transparence&lt;/strong&gt;, avec &lt;strong&gt;humilité&lt;/strong&gt; mais aussi avec &lt;strong&gt;persévérance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tout cela permet en tant que patient (ou proches de patients) de donner sa confiance à l&amp;rsquo;équipe et de sentir que l&amp;rsquo;on est toujours traiter comme une personne humaine ayant son intégrité et non comme un cas. Cela peut paraitre évident mais cela fait une différence énorme. &lt;strong&gt;Vraiment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;une-humanité-une-implication-et-une-transparence-rare&#34;&gt;Une humanité, une implication et une transparence rare.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le fait de pouvoir passer plusieurs heures par jour, 7 jours sur 7, pendant plusieurs semaines, auprès de son proche malade fait que nous sommes &lt;strong&gt;immergés&lt;/strong&gt; dans la vie du service. C&amp;rsquo;est une vraie avancée pour les familles qui font partie de la vie du service et ne sont plus des éléments périphériques, de passage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Il faut, je pense, pour tolérer cela en tant qu&amp;rsquo;équipe soignante une grande confiance en soi et une vraie volonté de transparence. Bravo, &lt;strong&gt;vraiment&lt;/strong&gt;, car cela change tout.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons pu voir comment &lt;strong&gt;toute l&amp;rsquo;équipe&lt;/strong&gt; (docteurs, aides-soignant.e.s, infirmier.e.s, kinés, psychologues, socio-esthéticiennes, personnel de ménage) faisait preuve d&amp;rsquo;une humanité constante dans leur comportement vis à vis des patients. Cela permet au patient de garder sa dignité malgré les moments de grande détresse et de grande vulnérabilité  qu&amp;rsquo;il traverse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;De même, dans les moments difficiles, la totalité du personnel était &lt;strong&gt;concerné&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;affecté&lt;/strong&gt;, à l&amp;rsquo;unisson de notre vécu. Le tout en mettant le traitement de la douleur au coeur de leurs préoccupations de soignants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dans les pratiques médicales de l&amp;rsquo;équipe, le patient est vraiment au coeur du sujet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Par exemple, lors des mises en sédation profonde, un cahier de suivi était mis à disposition afin de raconter jour par jour ce que le patient sédaté vivait, ce qui se passait autour de lui. Les soignants faisaient l&amp;rsquo;effort de le remplir quotidiennement tout autant que nous, sa famille. Au réveil du patient, ce cahier devient un outil de reconstruction qui lui permet d&amp;rsquo;objectiver ses &amp;ldquo;souvenirs&amp;rdquo;, ses cauchemars etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;un-accompagnement-tellement-utile&#34;&gt;Un accompagnement tellement utile.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;En parrallèle du soin pur de la maladie, des personnels interviennent auprès du patient et de ses proches comme la psychologue qui travaille de manière agile, mettant à profit toutes les opportunités pour faire parler, mettre des mots et donner des clés pour gérer ces moments si douloureux et traumatisants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;De même, une socio esthéticienne passe auprès des patients et son intervention est d&amp;rsquo;une aide réelle pour le maintien du bien être et de l&amp;rsquo;image de soi du patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Merci &lt;em&gt;aussi&lt;/em&gt; pour tout cela.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;merci&#34;&gt;Merci.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Un &lt;strong&gt;énorme et sincère merci&lt;/strong&gt;, donc, à &lt;strong&gt;tous&lt;/strong&gt; les membres de l&amp;rsquo;équipe de l&amp;rsquo;unité de réanimation et de soins intensifs de l&amp;rsquo;hôpital Saint André pour votre manière de fonctionner, votre implication, votre humanité.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Un dernier détail qui n&amp;rsquo;en est peut-être pas un : au moment de quitter votre service, où nous avions pourtant traversé tellement de moments douloureux, nous avons été saisi d&amp;rsquo;un bref moment de crainte, de ne pas vouloir quitter le service. &lt;em&gt;Significatif&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post scriptum :&lt;/strong&gt; ce parcours de soin s&amp;rsquo;est opéré au sein de l&amp;rsquo;hôpital public et aucune avance de frais ne nous a été demandé ni avant, ni après les soins. Traverser une telle épreuve sans avoir, &lt;em&gt;en plus&lt;/em&gt;, à se mobiliser pour payer les soins est une vraie aide tant pour les familles que pour la réussite des soins. Ce fut en effet autant d&amp;rsquo;énergie que nous avons pu investir dans l&amp;rsquo;accompagnement de notre proche.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cela est rendu possible grâce au fonctionnement actuel de notre système d&amp;rsquo;Assurance Maladie : &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;On contribue à hauteur de ses possiblités, on reçoit à hauteur de ses besoins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La seule leçon que nous voulons partager ici : n&amp;rsquo;oublions jamais la valeur de ce système, battons nous à chaque fois qu&amp;rsquo;il est attaqué tant sur son financement que sur le versant hospitalier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

This direction was very interesting for the RMLL but too far from our core topic to feel comfortable enough as track curators but also for the event organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are convinced of the value that Free Software provides to all of us, citizens of the world, in the Security area. And having a conference dedicated to it is a way for us to contribute to its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this page, we will expose our goals for this new conference and the way we want to follow to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-goals-for-pass-the-salt&#34;&gt;Our goals for Pass the SALT&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.pass-the-salt.org/images/werner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;werner&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;werner&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Discussion between François Marier, Eric Leblond and Werner Koch during 2013 RMLL Security Track in Brussels - photo CC BY-NC-SA by P. Teuwen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand the objectives and the spirit, Peter Czanik, lecturer, gave us some answers in the &lt;a href=&#34;%5Bhttps://www.balabit.com/blog/czp-rmll-libre-software-meeting-2017/&#34;&gt;report of his participation in the RMLL 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is how he summarized his coming at the 2017 RMLL Security track:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I participated again in Security track … &lt;strong&gt;“Participated”&lt;/strong&gt; as I did not only give a talk on syslog-ng there, but also sat in to most of the presentations and had &lt;strong&gt;very good discussions both with visitors and fellow speakers&lt;/strong&gt;. The organizers brought together &lt;strong&gt;talks from diverse IT security-related fields&lt;/strong&gt;, a very good opportunity for &lt;strong&gt;cross-pollination of ideas&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; emphasis is on our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Peter has perfectly synthesized what we are trying to achieve through the RMLL Security track year after year:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do our best to facilitate meetings and exchanges between lecturers and the public. The goal is that these exchanges generate collaborations between developers or projects but also produce new features in free software of the Security sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it is what we will want to achieve year after year with Pass the SALT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-reach-our-goals&#34;&gt;How to reach our goals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, we are not going to give a detailed list of things we think that have to be done but rather, a short list of important (according to us) levers that helped us reaching these goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&amp;gt; Cost: a free access event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we want to provide a free event to attendees. According to us, this is the best way to enable all kind of attendees to come : we think about students or people with low income but it is also a way to see professionals coming on their own without having to negociate money with their company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&amp;gt; Content: a security &amp;amp; free software event with most of the security topics covered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While respecting the technical and free software DNA of the conference, we try to ensure that &lt;strong&gt;as many security disciplines as possible are represented&lt;/strong&gt; in the topics covered by the talks and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the first 2 Pass the SALT editions, we managed to offer many different sessions with among other topics: low level security, offensive security, secure programming, security at scale, privacy or network security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We want both &lt;strong&gt;attendees and speakers to confront to different disciplines and topics of Security&lt;/strong&gt; that are not always familiar to them. This allows everyone to discover new fields of exploration and to pick innovative solutions that she/he can reuse in her/his projects or work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&amp;gt; For attendees: an open minded and accessible atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the different and varied subjects, we also try to establish a climate as friendly as possible in order to maximize exchanges. During the conference, it is very rare to find a “star attitude” among our speakers. They are all free software users and/or developers and so, perfectly understand the importance of sharing with and helping people. So, we set up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pauses:&lt;/strong&gt; during which, we do our best to &lt;strong&gt;encourage attendees to interact with speakers,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;social event:&lt;/strong&gt; organization provides some (usually 2) free drinks and tries to encourage one more time exchanges between people :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&amp;gt; For speakers: a comfortable and caring event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also very important for us that &lt;strong&gt;the speakers feel comfortable&lt;/strong&gt; for coming and attending : they usually don’t know the event (and so its attendees), the city and even sometimes the country. So we provide:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a dedicated communication channel:&lt;/strong&gt; on a private mailing list we provide complete information (how to come, to find accommodations, to do their talk, to contact us, to be reimbursed etc.),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;full contact list and fast feedback loop:&lt;/strong&gt; in order to be able to get in touch and have answers quickly from the org team,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;speakers dinner:&lt;/strong&gt; during the event, we also set up a speakers’ dinner. The goal is to provide them yet another opportunity to get to know each other better, exchange and let ideas “pollinate” :-)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for all lecturers to come in confidence, get rid of most of their practical questions to be able to take advantage of the event in the most open way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-for-which-result&#34;&gt;And for which result?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But so, for real, have you got any results to share? Yes we have!&lt;/strong&gt; Just give a look to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pass-the-salt.org/achievements/&#34;&gt;our achievements page&lt;/a&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/DEC_vt220.jpg/1920px-DEC_vt220.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;VT220 terminal - Photo under Public Domain license by Shansov.net / Wikimedia&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;VT220 terminal - Photo under Public Domain license by Shansov.net / Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered Unix (not Linux) at college in Bordeaux, in 1989. After a first course about Unix and its concepts, our professor gave us our credentials to be able to login on our school Unix system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This computer was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_9000#Server_models&#34;&gt;HP 9000 server&lt;/a&gt; running a Unix OS. The &amp;ldquo;machine room&amp;rdquo; was in fact divided in two rooms. The first one was the &amp;ldquo;white room&amp;rdquo;, a restricted access area with only the big box inside aka the main server : 1,5m high and several meters long. The second room was the room dedicated to the twenty passive terminals (VT100/VT220 emulation maybe) used to login on the Unix system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, with my user account and password, I sat in front of one of the terminals. I entered my user account and my password. &lt;strong&gt;Failed&lt;/strong&gt;. I just thinked that I mispelled one of them, I retried and I managed to log in. The rest of the session was successful : I was able to try the few commands I learned during my first lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But. The day after, I was not able to log in anymore. 2nd year students were just laughing in the terminals room. I asked why. They stopped laughing, picked a terminal and introduced me to the &lt;strong&gt;.logout functionnality&lt;/strong&gt;. It is used to execute a set of commands when you leave your current session. They have customized their own .logout script in order to display a screen almost identical to the normal login screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, you see?&lt;/strong&gt; My first try to enter my credentials the day before was done on a &lt;strong&gt;faked login screen&lt;/strong&gt; ;-) The student who was connected before me got my credentials and just has to change my password. After getting my credentials, the commands executed by the .logout script ended and the student session also. So I retried to enter my credentials in front of the real login screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was in 1989. On a Unix system. Connected to &amp;hellip; nothing : no network available at this time on this server. And password theft was already a game :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

Contrairement à l&amp;rsquo;ainée, elle n&amp;rsquo;avait jamais eu envie d&amp;rsquo;aller sur Internet et je me disais que son apprentissage allait être plus laborieux que pour sa sœur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;L&amp;rsquo;an passé, ma fille de 10 ans, en CM2, a donc découvert le web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elle n&amp;rsquo;avait jusque là utiliser les ordis de la maison, tant sous Ubuntu que Vista, que pour jouer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Là, son instit lui avait demandé d&amp;rsquo;effectuer une recherche sur Raphaël, le peintre italien.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Du coup, on démarre sous son profil sur Ubuntu. Je lui explique les bases d&amp;rsquo;un navigateur web (Firefox inside ;) ) : la zone d&amp;rsquo;adresse, la zone de recherche, les moteurs de recherches enregistrés.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;On peut rajouter des moteurs de recherches ? Trop classe !&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;Je souris ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Puis explication des liens hypertextes, changement de pages, puis explication de Wikipedia, son fonctionnement, ses limites :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wikipedia est écrit par des gens comme toi et moi. Ils peuvent faire des erreurs. Il faut croiser ses sources (dico, magazines etc)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mais je sentais bien que je &lt;strong&gt;la barbais un peu&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Je la laisse donc sur Wikipedia faire ses recherches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Je lui explique juste que, comme pour la TV, elle peut tomber sur une page qui la gène voire l&amp;rsquo;agresse et, dans ce cas là, elle doit fermer la fenêtre ou quitter l&amp;rsquo;écran et venir me le dire immédiatement pour en discuter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Au bout de 10 minutes, devinez quoi ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elle :&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Papa, là, je crois qu&amp;rsquo;ils se sont trompés sur Wikipédia !&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Moi (dubitatif) :&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tu es sûre, ma puce ?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Elle :&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oui, oui.

Elle s&amp;rsquo;en est servi pour détecter l&amp;rsquo;erreur et trouver le bon lien un peu plus loin dans la page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;étais vraiment content qu&amp;rsquo;elle ait pu voir &lt;strong&gt;par elle même&lt;/strong&gt; que :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ce qu&amp;rsquo;elle lit sur Internet doit être vérifié&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;le principal intérêt des &lt;strong&gt;constructions collaboratives comme Wikipédia&lt;/strong&gt;, c&amp;rsquo;est &lt;strong&gt;la capacité à apporter aux autres&lt;/strong&gt; sa connaissance et ce, sans entrave.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Du coup, &lt;strong&gt;le premier jour de sa découverte du web&lt;/strong&gt;, elle fit &lt;strong&gt;sa première contribution&lt;/strong&gt; en &lt;a href=&#34;https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rapha%C3%ABl_%28peintre%29&amp;amp;diff=71014717&amp;amp;oldid=70781184&#34;&gt;modifiant la page de Raphael sur Wikipedia FR&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour une soirée d&amp;rsquo;initiation à Internet et au web, cela a été plutôt riche :) Si cela peut servir à d&amp;rsquo;autres comme idée d&amp;rsquo;approche du web &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happy :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commentaires (récupérés post crash serveur) :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ac6bd8f5222fed869d6fd03314e25af&#34; alt=&#34;Tristan&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Tristan&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://standblog.org/&#34;&gt;Tristan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, 18 décembre 2012 :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elle en a dans le ciboulot, la petite !

Nous trouverons les locaux en fonction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Si cela peut paraitre sensé dit comme cela (moi même j&amp;rsquo;ai fini par dire, ben oui, c&amp;rsquo;est comme cela qu&amp;rsquo;il faut raisonner), cela nous a surtout poussé à une sorte de course au gigantisme qui, si elle n&amp;rsquo;a pas été fatale, a eu des impacts notables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mais-il-est-où-le-souci-&#34;&gt;Mais il est où le souci ?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Il est dans les points suivants tous remontés par des organisateurs ou des participants :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;un thème majeur était l&amp;rsquo;accessibilité et notre organisation physique était un contre sens pour des personnes souffrant d&amp;rsquo;handicap quel qu&amp;rsquo;il soit&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;les rencontres (entre les publics, les communautés, les univers) pourtant au coeur de notre événement ont été affectées par cet éclatement&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;un tel éclatement empêche ou diminue sensiblement la capacité d&amp;rsquo;appréhension de l&amp;rsquo;événement par un visiteur étranger&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;l&amp;rsquo;organisation pratique (signalisation, conférences, captations vidéo, réseau, village etc) est juste rendue extrêmement plus difficile qu&amp;rsquo;avec un lieu unique.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et j&amp;rsquo;en oublie certainement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mais-cest-quoi-ta-solution-magique-à-toi-&#34;&gt;Mais c&amp;rsquo;est quoi ta solution magique à toi ?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;il faut sélectionner &lt;strong&gt;un lieu unique&lt;/strong&gt;. Un lieu le plus grand possible, doté des bonnes infrastructures (électricité, réseau, salles) mais un lieu unique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et après on taille l&amp;rsquo;événement en fonction :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nombre de thèmes et leur durée&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;taille du village&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;événements supplémentaires éventuels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cette solution n&amp;rsquo;est pas magique, elle a aussi des inconvénients comme devoir prioriser des choses par rapport à d&amp;rsquo;autres (diminuer le nombre de conférences par exemple).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mais, cette solution a le mérite je pense de privilégier la qualité d&amp;rsquo;accueil, les échanges et la simplicité de l&amp;rsquo;organisation ce qui me semble primordial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commentaires (récupérés post crash serveur) :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2b6e2e7960ddef67eb1073283981a21&#34; alt=&#34;PaulK&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;PaulK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulk.fr/&#34;&gt;PaulK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, 8 août 2010 :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Je suis tout à fait d&amp;rsquo;accord. Ayant participé à ces RMLL, je pense aussi que la séparation entre différents lieux a été le gros point noir (je crois que j&amp;rsquo;ai eu à courir pour ne pas arriver en retard à une conf&amp;rsquo; à peu près chaque les jours).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

The 3 topics covered will be :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/2010/07/13/RMLL-LSM-2010-Th%C3%A8mes-et-partage-dune-vision-commune/&#34;&gt;Topics and sharing a same vision (fr)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;internationalization (this post)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/2010/07/16/RMLL-LSM-2010-Perfect-setup/&#34;&gt;RMLL : perfect setup (fr)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclamer&lt;/strong&gt; : the ideas below are only mine and any way not those of the 2010 LSM organization team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s speak about something that has been quite important for me this year : setting up a cross technical topics track in english.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the 2009 LSM, I have set up with my security topic co-chairmen an English spoken afternoon with the english speakers. The French speakers that have also their talks during this afternoon have to do them in English too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that I have a quite long discussion with &lt;a href=&#34;http://thomas.enix.org/&#34;&gt;Thomas Petazzoni&lt;/a&gt; on internalization of talks and of the event : for Thomas,a solution combining efficiently French and English for talks does not exist. Either LSM is a total French speaking event or LSM will become a full English spoken talks event. For me, combining the two languages is a crucial point. Let&amp;rsquo;s see why (from my point of view only of course &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-combining-english-and-french-talks-is-important&#34;&gt;Why combining English and French talks is important?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand why combining the two languages in talks is important, it is necessary to understand my vision of the utility of events like LSM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LSM for me (tends to) address several problems :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;setting up bridges between free software developers from different communities&lt;/strong&gt; (embedded vs Internet vs OS vs development etc) and languages&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;brings free software expertise from whatever it comes&lt;/strong&gt; to LSM visitors&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;installs less barriers as possible between expertise and visitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, to meet these expectations we have to be able to :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;invite non french spoken speakers (expertise, bridge)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;combine their talks with french talks (bridge, less barriers)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-2010-answer-at-a-program-level&#34;&gt;The 2010 answer at a Program level&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we invite english spoken speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And in counterpart, to put them in a situation the more comfortable we can, we decide this year to set up a cross technical topics continuous english spoken track. Our goal was to be able to say to english spearkers that at any hour of any day of LSM, they were able to find a technical talk in english.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is exactly what we manage to set up through the commitment and hard work of all topic chairmen and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is here :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2010.rmll.info/+-En-anglais-+.html&#34;&gt;English program details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2010.rmll.info/spip.php?page=rmll_progall&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;k=10&#34;&gt;English tracks schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-do-not-succeed-to-provide-a-comfortable-event-for-english-speakers-&#34;&gt;Why we do not succeed to provide a comfortable event for English speakers ?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, because if you want to do so, it is definitively not at the Program level you have to work. It is at the top level of the event organization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through several long and deep discussions with &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.fosdem.org/2006/index/speakers/speakers_pereira.html&#34;&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jamey_sharp&#34;&gt;Jamey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Sharp&#34;&gt;Sarah Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, and Thomas several points emerge :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inconsistent signalization and translations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English track for talks has not been actively promoted enough&lt;/strong&gt; on the website&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a single point of contact for foreign speakers has always to be set up&lt;/strong&gt; because coming from Oslo or Sydney and only speaking English is far not as simple as coming from Paris and speaking French&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a single location is a definitive requirement&lt;/strong&gt; to make talks, people, events easily accessed for English spoken people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I mention only a subset of all the remarks they made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ways-to-improve-the-process&#34;&gt;Ways to improve the process&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we have to address above problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I have to select one proposal, it would be the proposal made by Jamey which would be a major step IMHO on the road on a successful internationalized event : having a non French speaking person in the core team of the organization to be the &amp;ldquo;International conscience&amp;rdquo; of the event. This person would check all materials produced by the organization (website, practical informations, locations, process etc) from an International point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jamey said also it would be necessary to made an international call for paper. I agree despite the fact it requires some solids networks to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to understand why even small details can break your initiative on the road to success, I let the final word to Sarah :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You want an idea to improve my LSM experience ? Just add a flag on the badge of each person to say what language each person speaks !&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/badge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;badge&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;badge&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enough said !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We try, we don&amp;rsquo;t (entirely) succeed, we want to improve : thank you for your presence and your already made feedbacks ! We welcome another feedbaks of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my part, I strongly believe mix-language speakers and talks are requirements to improve exchanges, networks but also local (the french area where LSM takes place each year) access to Free Software expertise. But to do so, we have to improve STRONGLY the way we handle internationalization of the event and the way we receive foreign people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <guid>https://blog.brocas.org/2010/07/13/RMLL-LSM-2010-Th%C3%A8mes-et-partage-dune-vision-commune/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/direction.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voilà, les &lt;a href=&#34;http://2010.rmll.info&#34;&gt;RMLL 2010&lt;/a&gt; ont fermé leurs portes au public (beaucoup sont encore en train de ranger &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;préambule&#34;&gt;Préambule&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Il est désormais temps de mettre par écrit quelques sentiments, impressions et enseignements que j’ai pu tirer de cette semaine très chargée en termes de boulot, rencontres et échanges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ce billet est le premier d’une série de 3 qui auront pour sujet :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thèmes et partage d’une vision commune (ce billet)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/2010/07/13/RMLL-LSM-2010-Internationalization/&#34;&gt;Internationalization (en)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/2010/07/16/RMLL-LSM-2010-Perfect-setup/&#34;&gt;RMLL : perfect setup (fr)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclamer :&lt;/strong&gt; ces idées/sentiments/enseignements ne sont que des idées personnelles et ne représentent en aucun cas les idées/sentiments/enseignements du comité d’organisation des RMLL 2010 sur cette édition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;gestion-des-thèmes&#34;&gt;Gestion des thèmes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cela faisait deux ans que j’étais coordinateur de thème (&lt;a href=&#34;http://2008.rmll.info/-Securite-.html&#34;&gt;sécurité&lt;/a&gt; en 2008 et &lt;a href=&#34;http://2009.rmll.info/-Systemes-et-securite-.html&#34;&gt;adminsys/sécu&lt;/a&gt; en 2009).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cette année, en tant que régional de l’étape et garçon un peu expérimenté, le comité d’orga m’a proposé d’intégrer le comité de programmes. J’ai accepté avec joie :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Une fois la liste des thèmes définie, le travail d’un membre du comité de programmes consiste notamment à trouver les responsables de thèmes qui géreront ces thèmes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le travail d’un responsable de thèmes est le suivant :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;assurer la sélection des conférences qui sont proposées (voire à en chercher d’autres)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;assurer le suivi des conférences retenues. Cela inclut leur saisie dans l’interface de programmes, leur planification, le suivi budgétaire du conférencier (niveau de prise en charge) etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une fois sur place, être présent dans la salle de conférences pour assurer le bon déroulement : présentation du conférencier, respect des horaires, récupération et mise en ligne de la présentation, suivi des remboursements, debriefing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et le tout en concertation permanente avec le comité de programmes : bref, du boulot !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dernier point important :&lt;/strong&gt; tout le travail de préparation du responsable de thèmes jusqu’à l’événement se fait online. Et surtout il n’a de lien avec l’organisation physique de l’événement que via le comité de programmes (moi et Patrice cette année pour les thèmes techniques).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;partage-de-vision&#34;&gt;Partage de vision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afin de comprendre cet événement, il est bon de savoir que les RMLL c’est :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une mission d’&lt;strong&gt;évangélisation&lt;/strong&gt; et de partage sur la région où elles se passent. Cette mission associative et éducative implique que toute personne touchée supplémentaire est un objectif accompli.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une &lt;strong&gt;organisation bénévole&lt;/strong&gt; qui chaque année se renouvelle en grande partie. Cela signifie qu’au niveau des thèmes, nous ne sommes que le bout VISIBLE de l’iceberg qui bosse derrière dans l’ombre pour que ce grand bazar de milliers de spectateurs/participants fonctionne.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une organisation qui est importante en termes de budget géré, partenaires engagés. Cela impose une &lt;strong&gt;implication&lt;/strong&gt; et un &lt;strong&gt;sérieux&lt;/strong&gt; (même en short+tongs !) vital pour que les RMLL soient la manifestation attendue par le public et les partenaires qui l’ont soutenues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;points-à-améliorer-par-rapport-à-cette-année&#34;&gt;Points à améliorer par rapport à cette année&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le fait de confier la responsabilité d’un thème aux RMLL à quelqu’un implique donc qu’il ait pleinement conscience de ces éléments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et c’est là où je pense je n’ai pas su anticiper un point pas vital mais tout de même important. Les RMLL ont une mission, une histoire et un fonctionnement qu’il faut partager et servir tous de la même manière.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, à mon niveau, je pense m’être contenté de trouver :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une personne compétente sur le thème en question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une personne utilisant/contribuant à des LL&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une personne motivée&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et cela ne suffit pas ! J’aurais aussi dû insister sur le caractère associatif, militant et exigeant de cette manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Etre responsable de thèmes c’est &lt;strong&gt;aussi&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prendre en compte dans son attitude et sa communication les gens qui travaillent dans l’ombre sur l’événement et/ou depuis très longtemps en amont,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;penser collectif, se sentir membre à part entière de l’équipe d’orga et non simplement comme un individu qui gère sa mission&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prendre conscience que les RMLL sont un travail militant toujours en cours qui avance d’année en année. On s’inscrit dans une histoire et on monte sur les épaules des gens qui ont travaillé avant nous. Cela mérite le respect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ces trois points, je ne pense pas les avoir assez promus auprès des responsables de thèmes de cette année. Cela n’a rien engendré de facheux, juste quelques incompréhensions inutiles qui, si ce travail amont avait été (mieux) fait, n’auraient pas existées.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;En dehors de cela, je pense que les 360 confs/ateliers/tables rondes/etc &amp;hellip; n’étaient pas mal du tout :-) &lt;strong&gt;Merci à vous tous&lt;/strong&gt;, responsables de thèmes, pour votre travail !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.brocas.org/2009/05/28/Article-MISC-mai-2007-Mon-serveur-DNS-mon-IDS-oubli%C3%A9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cet article est issu de l’article publié dans le numéro de &lt;strong&gt;MISC n°31 de Mai 2007&lt;/strong&gt;. J’en suis l’auteur (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:christophe.brocas@free.fr&#34;&gt;christophe.brocas@free.fr&lt;/a&gt;). Tous droits réservés à MISC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Je le poste ici car l’idée d’utiliser son serveur DNS semble être dans l’actualité du monde de la détection d’intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/dns-mort1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;mon-serveur-dns-mon-ids-préféré&#34;&gt;Mon serveur DNS, mon IDS préféré&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christophe Brocas, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:christophe.brocas@free.fr&#34;&gt;christophe.brocas@free.fr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le Système d’Information (SI) des entreprises est un capital de ressources à protéger des attaques et, si une attaque réussit, la compromission et les évasions de données doivent être détectées le plus tôt possible. Pour détecter des postes compromis sur le réseau de l’entreprise, des solutions complexes et onéreuses sont souvent proposées aux Directeurs Informatiques (DSI) mais le plus souvent, peu de solutions de détection anti-intrusions sont effectivement en place. Or, la bonne compréhension à la fois de son architecture et du comportement des codes malicieux présents sur les postes compromis permet de proposer une première réponse élégante, peu couteuse et efficiente à cette problématique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-compromission-de-postes--une-détection-quelle-détection-&#34;&gt;1.1 Compromission de postes : une détection, quelle détection ?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afin de sécuriser son SI, une entreprise doit déployer une interconnexion applicative filtrée par des proxies et des serveurs dédiées (exemples : filtrage http/smtp, relais dns) afin de pouvoir fixer des règles de sécurité consistantes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cependant, une fois cette architecture déployée, la majorité des entreprises ne semble pas se préoccuper des tentatives de contournement/d’accès direct à l’extérieur depuis un poste du LAN compromis. Elles se reposent généralement sur les différentes alertes que peuvent remonter les solutions d’antivirus postes et serveurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, si les protections amont de filtrages des flux HTTP/SMTP sont utiles, la détection des postes compromis est nécessaire tant sur le plan de l’intégrité des données de son SI que sur le plan de la responsabilité de l’entreprise qui pourrait ainsi fournir, par exemple, une base à des réseaux de postes zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-avoir-un-ids-sans-le-savoir&#34;&gt;1.2 Avoir un IDS sans le savoir&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La solution ? L’analyse des serveurs applicatifs est un moyen simple de connaître les compromissions potentielles dans son LAN. Les logs du serveur DNS et, dans une moindre mesure, ceux du pare-feu sont des sources de données disponibles pour effectuer cette veille anti-intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concentrons-nous sur le DNS : comment diable un serveur DNS peut-il nous révéler les intrusions déjà effectuées sur son réseau ? Et les réponses sont :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;comprendre le comportement des différents types de codes malicieux présents sur les postes compromis ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;en déduire les types de requêtes DNS pouvant être émis par ces codes ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;en fonction de ces profils, analyser les logs du serveur DNS et isoler les postes susceptibles d’être compromis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-architecture-à-base-de-proxies-et-de-relais--un-pré-requis-nécessaire&#34;&gt;2. Architecture à base de proxies et de relais : un pré-requis nécessaire&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mais, attention, dans les logs d’un serveur DNS, rien ne distingue une requête émise par un poste de celle émise par un autre. Le seul moyen de stigmatiser une requête émise par un poste en particulier est de pouvoir définir le comportement normal d’un poste en termes de requêtes DNS. Et ce, par rapport à celui, différent, des serveurs de type proxies ou relais.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-flux-vers-linternet--authentication-required-&#34;&gt;2.1 Flux vers l’Internet : &amp;ldquo;authentication required&amp;rdquo; !&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les flux émis vers l’Internet depuis un poste de travail sont nombreux :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;émis consciemment par l’utilisateur : envoi d’email, navigation sur le web ou téléchargement de fichiers etc ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mais aussi émis de manière invisible pour l’utilisateur : mise à jour du système d’exploitation, rapatriement de mises à jour antivirales etc .&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et je ne parle que des flux légitimes !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/dns-ids-oublie/trame11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1 :&lt;/strong&gt; architecture proxies et serveurs relais&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et pour être reconnus comme légitimes, l’ensemble de ces flux doivent être soumis à habilitation. Pour cela, il faut que ces flux soient reroutés de manière systématique vers des équipements de filtrage nécessitant une habilitation, à savoir les proxies ou serveur relais. Habilitation que devra renseigner l’utilisateur pour chaque type de flux.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-proxies-et-relais-uniques-émetteurs-de-requêtes-dns-vers-internet&#34;&gt;2.2 Proxies et relais, uniques émetteurs de requêtes DNS vers Internet&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les machines proxies ou relais se doivent, pour être utilisées, d’exiger de l’utilisateur une authentification. Cela se traduit par des demandes d’identification HTTP par le proxy HTTP ou l’utilisation de SMTP AUTH pour l’envoi de mail via le serveur SMTP de votre entreprise. Les flux émis par les postes vers Internet sont alors authentifiés, donc moins sujet à être vecteur d’attaques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/dns-ids-oublie/trame31.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2 :&lt;/strong&gt; étapes d’une requête HTTP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le gain de cette architecture en termes de détection d’intrusion ? Tout le trafic émis par les postes à destination de l’Internet est dans un premier temps redirigé vers ces machines intermédiaires. Les requêtes DNS de résolution de domaines internet ne sont alors plus émises que par ces équipements proxies et relais :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;En effet, afin de pouvoir router, par exemple, les requêtes HTTP vers &lt;code&gt;google.fr&lt;/code&gt; émises par un poste (point 1 sur la figure 2) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Le proxy de l’entreprise demande une résolution DNS de type A sur le domaine &lt;code&gt;google.fr&lt;/code&gt; (point 2) pour le compte de ce poste ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;La requête peut ensuite être émise vers le serveur HTTP cible (point 3).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB :&lt;/strong&gt; Il en est de même pour les envois de mails où le serveur SMTP joue le rôle du proxy HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comme vous pouvez le voir, grâce à cette architecture centralisée et maîtrisée, les logs de votre serveur DNS deviennent de manière mécanique des sources fiables de données de détection d’intrusion : toute demande de résolution DNS d’un domaine internet émise par un poste lambda peut être considérée comme une alerte d’une compromission potentielle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-configuration-du-serveur-dns-bind&#34;&gt;3. Configuration du serveur DNS Bind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-configuration-par-défaut--état-des-lieux&#34;&gt;3.1 Configuration par défaut : état des lieux&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les configurations figurant dans cet article décrivent la configuration d’un serveur DNS Bind et ont été testées avec un serveur Bind en version stable 9.3.2 sous Ubuntu 6.06.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La configuration par défaut d’un serveur DNS Bind ne collecte pas dans ses fichiers de logs les requêtes émises par les clients DNS. En effet, ces requêtes peuvent générer beaucoup d’écritures dans ces fichiers dont la taille peut donc augmenter rapidement. Nous allons donc utiliser la gestion automatique des fichiers de logs fournie par Bind, gestion améliorée depuis la version 9.3 par la gestion d’une taille maximale de fichiers de logs. Une présentation des options de logging de Bind a été faite dans un article précédent de MISC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-collecte-des-requêtes-clientes-dans-les-logs-de-bind&#34;&gt;3.2 Collecte des requêtes clientes dans les logs de Bind&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voici un exemple de définition d’un channel permettant de collecter les requêtes émises par les clients :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Declenchement du log des requetes au demarrage de Bind&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;querylog;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# paragraphe definissant le logging&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;logging {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Parametrage du canal des requetes&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   channel querieslogs {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Envoi vers le fichier queries&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;log avec roulement de &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; archives de &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;Mo&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;              file &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;queries.log&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; versions &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; size &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;m;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Affiche la date du message dans les logs&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;              print&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;time yes;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Affiche le nom de la categorie du message&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;              print&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;category yes;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Envoi des requetes dans notre canal querieslogs&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;       category queries { querieslogs; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;};&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des fichiers de configuration complets pour chaque type de serveur (cache interne, cache internet, maitre interne et maitre internet avec des sections de logs complètes sont disponibles sur le site de MISC. De plus, vous trouverez la documentation exhaustive des options de log de Bind en ligne sur le site du logiciel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-que-chercher-dans-les-logs-&#34;&gt;4. Que chercher dans les logs ?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-topologie-du-comportement-réseaux-des-codes-malicieux&#34;&gt;4.1 Topologie du comportement réseaux des codes malicieux&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Un poste de travail compromis par un code malicieux a pour vocation de devenir une source d’informations émises à destination de serveurs externes, ou une source d’attaques pouvant être pilôtées ou pas depuis Internet. Dans les deux cas, une communication vers des serveurs externes tentera d’être initiée. Ces serveurs peuvent être des cibles d’attaques (spams, dénis de services distribuées), des serveurs de contrôle fournissant des instructions aux codes malicieux distribuées ou bien des serveurs de collecte d’informations usurpées à l’utilisateur du poste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-requêtes-dns-émises-par-des-codes-malicieux&#34;&gt;4.2 Requêtes DNS émises par des codes malicieux&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ils existent deux grands types de requêtes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;les requêtes de type &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; qui sont émises par les moteurs d’envoi de spams et de virus qui sont lancés sur les postes une fois compromis. De même, ces requêtes servent à ces codes malicieux pour se propager via email. Ce type de requête fournit le nom et l’adresse IP du(des) serveur(s) SMTP réceptionnant pour le domaine passé en paramètre ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;les requêtes de type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; représentent la majeure partie des requêtes restantes. Ces requêtes peuvent alors correspondre à des demandes de résolution de noms de futures cibles, de serveurs de téléchargement de nouveaux codes malicieux (ou de mises à jour) ou encore de sites fournissant des ordres aux codes malicieux(serveurs IRC par exemple) .&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour les requêtes &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt;, on peut en avoir la trace pas plus loin que dans sa messagerie. Exemple d’entête de spam dans la BAL de votre serviteur :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;]&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Received: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;200.253.154.11&lt;/span&gt; (HELO data&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;app&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com) (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;200.253.154.11&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  by mrelay5&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;free&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;fr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; SMTP; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt; Dec &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Message&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ID: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;c71fb7&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;588313&lt;/span&gt;d0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0200&lt;/span&gt;a8c0&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@servidor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reply&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;To: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Kalpana Lo&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Kalpana Lo&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Charles Chickering&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subject: Re:&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;]&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On y voit un mail émis directement depuis un poste sur l’Internet vers le serveur &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; de l’hébergeur de ma BAL. Cette émission a donc fait l’objet d’une demande de résolution &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; pour le domaine &lt;code&gt;free.fr&lt;/code&gt; sur le serveur DNS du poste internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-exploitation-des-logs-dns&#34;&gt;5. Exploitation des logs DNS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-extraction-des-données&#34;&gt;5.1 Extraction des données&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ egrep -v -i &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;@IP1|@IP2&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; /var/log/queries.1og | egrep -v -i mondomaine.fr&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;La ligne de commandes précédente permet :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;d’isoler l’ensemble des requêtes émises par les postes de travail (premier grep) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;demandant une requête sur un domaine différent du domaine de l’entreprise ici nommé mondomaine.fr (second grep).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les données produites par cette commande correspondent à une liste d’adresses IP ayant un comportement DNS anormal selon les critères décrit dans le &lt;a href=&#34;#42-requ%C3%AAtes-dns-%C3%A9mises-par-des-codes-malicieux&#34;&gt;chapitre 4&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[...]&#xA;22-Jan-2007 22:55:24.978 queries: client 192.168.0.190#32788: query: google.fr IN A +&#xA;22-Jan-2007 22:55:49.228 queries: client 192.168.0.190#32788: query: hotmail.com IN MX +&#xA;[...]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;On voit dans l’exemple ci-dessus un poste interne d’adresse IP &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.190&lt;/code&gt; demander au DNS l’adresse IP de google.fr ainsi que celle du serveur SMTP gérant le domaine &lt;code&gt;hotmail.com&lt;/code&gt;. Or, ces deux requêtes ne devraient jamais être émises par un poste du LAN car elles portent sur un domaine différent de celui de l’entreprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;En effet, ces deux requêtes DNS devraient avoir été émises respectivement par le proxy HTTP et par le relais de messagerie de l’entreprise. Ces deux machines ayant auparavant demandé son habilitation HTTP ou l’utilisateur de messagerie à l’utilisateur du poste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB :&lt;/strong&gt; On peut bien entendu spécialiser cette ligne de commandes pour obtenir soit les requêtes de type &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; soit les requêtes de type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-faux-positifs--explications-et-actions-correctrices&#34;&gt;5.2 Faux positifs ? Explications et actions correctrices&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons décrit dans le chapitre 2 un &lt;a href=&#34;#2-architecture-%C3%A0-base-de-proxies-et-de-relais--un-pr%C3%A9-requis-n%C3%A9cessaire&#34;&gt;pré-requis ambitieux&lt;/a&gt; qui était que toutes les communications ou tentatives de communication vers Internet émises par les postes de travail passaient par un proxy ou une machine relais. Or, la première analyse que vous allez mener sur les données extraites des logs de votre serveur DNS risque fort de plus vous mettre sur la trace de postes lançant des Windows Update que sur celle de postes zombies (du moins je l’espère pour votre LAN ;-) ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vos premières actions vont donc être de travailler sur ces mécanismes légitimes s’exécutant sur vos postes et émettant des requêtes vers l’Internet :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;de forcer le passage par proxy des actions qui le peuvent ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;d’inactiver les mécanismes s’exécutant mais finalement ne le devant pas ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;de noter les mécanismes devant absolument exécuter des connexions externes directes afin de les exclure des remontées des logs DNS. Notez bien que ce type de connexion devrait être rarissime car étant anormales en termes de politique de sécurité.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;53-gestion-des-alarmes&#34;&gt;5.3 Gestion des alarmes&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La liste des adresses IP ainsi remontées par la scrutation du fichier queries.log permet aux administrateurs des postes et au responsable sécurité de déclencher les actions appropriées.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parmi elles, on peut lister les quelques actions suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mise hors réseau du poste incriminé ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;recherche du code malicieux ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;recherche de l’explication de la compromission : manque de suivi des mises à jour antivirales, mise en ligne du poste directement sur le net (ex: à domicile), contournement de la politique de sécurité etc ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;remasterisation du poste avec restauration des données sauvegardées à une date antérieure à la compromission si la date est identifiée ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-limites-et-pistes-daméliorations&#34;&gt;6. Limites et pistes d’améliorations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;61-limites&#34;&gt;6.1 Limites&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le processus de recherche de postes compromis que nous venons de décrire possède des limites liées au fait que nous travaillons sur le serveur DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les limites majeures viennent du fait que l’on suppose que le code malicieux n’utilisera pas de données d’authentification dérobées à l’utilisateur du poste. Ainsi, l’émission de mails en SMTP authentifié à travers le relais SMTP de l’entreprise. Idem pour l’utilisation du proxy HTTP de l’entreprise pour attaquer un site extérieur ou récupérer des ordres d’un serveur de synchronisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La remarque que l’on peut faire est que la majorité des codes malicieux sont conçus pour travailler sur des architectures ouvertes (DNS/SMTP/HTTP ouverts vers l’extérieur).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;62-pistes-damélioration&#34;&gt;6.2 Pistes d’amélioration&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elles sont de deux ordres : exploitabilité de la solution et consolidation des données DNS avec les tentatives d’accès direct à l’extérieur par adresses IP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;L’exploitabilité de cette solution serait de travailler sur l’enchainement des opérations de recherche dans les fichiers de logs, cyclage, compression et suppression de ces fichiers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour ce qui est de la consolidation, il faudrait déclencher de telles recherches sur les rejets du Firewall concernant des requêtes en provenance de postes en plan d’adressage interne (ex: &lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt;) à destination d’adresses externes (vers l’internet donc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-conclusion&#34;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comme nous venons de le voir, une architecture qui permet de bien maîtriser les flux de données couplée à une analyse des logs de son (ses) serveur(s) DNS permet de disposer d’une sonde de détection de postes compromis. Cette solution a l’avantage d’être légère, non structurante et &amp;hellip; ne coûte rien ! Cela n’empêche en aucun cas le RSSI ou le DSI de doter l’entreprise de solutions plus complète (et complexe), intrusive et chère.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;de-la-sécurité-dune-architecture-dns-dentreprise&#34;&gt;De la sécurité d&amp;rsquo;une architecture DNS d&amp;rsquo;entreprise&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cet article est issu de l’article publié dans le numéro 23 de MISC. Ses auteurs sont Christophe Brocas (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:christophe.brocas@free.fr&#34;&gt;christophe.brocas@free.fr&lt;/a&gt;) et Jean-Michel Farin (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jeanmichel.farin@free.fr&#34;&gt;jeanmichel.farin@free.fr&lt;/a&gt;). Tous droits réservés à MISC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ces dix dernières années, les entreprises ont vu une interconnexion toujours croissante de leurs systèmes d’informations (SI), entre eux ainsi qu’avec l’internet. Cette interconnexion s’est accompagnée d’une adoption massive de protocoles standards. Parmi ces protocoles, le DNS (Domain Name Service) affiche la double caractéristique d’être le plus systématiquement utilisé et sûrement le moins correctement surveillé.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le DNS est souvent vu comme un protocole utilitaire au fonctionnement opaque. Et à la vue de son caractère primordial pour le bon fonctionnement des protocoles applicatifs tels SMTP ou HTTP, les portes de ce protocole sont souvent laissées grandes ouvertes tout au long de la chaîne de liaison du SI (postes, serveurs, routeurs etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous verrons dans cet article comment sécuriser ce protocole et en particulier son implémentation dans un réseau d’entreprise. Les exemples de configuration reposeront sur le logiciel Bind, version 9.1.x et suivantes &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-terminologie&#34;&gt;1.1 Terminologie&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Avant de plonger dans le DNS, accordons nous sur les termes utilisés dans ce document :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolver :&lt;/strong&gt; logiciel client DNS sollicité par les applications sur les postes clients afin d’obtenir une résolution ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;serveur cache :&lt;/strong&gt; serveur sollicité par les resolvers ou par d’autres serveurs cache. Ce type de serveur assure la fonction de récupération d’informations auprès de serveurs de noms ou d’autres serveurs cache. Il stocke les informations collectées dans son cache. Ce serveur ne gérant aucune zone DNS, le type de recherche supportée est récursif ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;serveur SOA :&lt;/strong&gt; serveur de noms faisant autorité répondant aux requêtes pour une (ou plusieurs) zone(s). Ce serveur n’ayant pour mission que de répondre à des requêtes sur un ou plusieurs domaines, dans notre configuration, nous n’autorisons aucune récursion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-les-vulnérabilités-dns&#34;&gt;1.2 Les vulnérabilités DNS&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;À présent, regardons les différents types de menaces pouvant toucher le DNS :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;la &lt;strong&gt;fuite d’informations&lt;/strong&gt; via des canaux cachés ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;la &lt;strong&gt;corruption de résolution DNS&lt;/strong&gt; permettant d’abuser les utilisateurs du système, d’informations et de leur dérober des informations sensibles ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;le &lt;strong&gt;déni de services&lt;/strong&gt; par l’acceptation de requêtes illégales ou par corruption de données dans les zones hébergées par les serveurs DNS internes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La fuite d’informations&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;La fuite d’informations par tunnel DNS a été couverte de manière complète dans les pages de MISC &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Les contre-mesures pour lutter contre ce type d’évasion se concentreront autour de la politique d’accès au service DNS ainsi qu’aux requêtes autorisées en fonction du type de client. La mise en oeuvre de cette politique sera décrite dans le paragraphe &amp;quot; Configuration du serveur DNS cache interne &amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corruption de résolution&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Ce type d’attaque a pour but de corrompre les données DNS fournies au client afin de, par exemple, le diriger à son insu vers des sites différents de ceux visés. Et ainsi, de lui dérober tout type d’informations sensibles.&#xA;Ce type d’attaque peut être réalisé par :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;compromission du processus de résolution ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;modification du trafic DNS ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ou compromission des données dans le cache d’un serveurs de noms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les réponses que cet article amènera viseront à :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sécuriser le processus de résolution et en maîtriser les possibilités de modification ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;limiter au strict minimum l’usage des requêtes récursives ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;s’assurer de l’intégrité des transactions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le déni de services&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Le déni de services distribué est une menace commune à tous les protocoles TCP/IP implémentés sur les serveurs accessibles de l’internet. En dehors des mesures de protections réseau (IPS) ou de répartition de charges, peu de réponses spécifiques à la configuration DNS peuvent être appliquées. Cependant, les mesures suivantes permettent limiter l’impact et l’implication des serveurs dns dans ces attaques :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;restriction des transferts de zone ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;interdiction de toute récursion ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;contrôle des requêtes simples ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;restriction des notifications.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-architecture&#34;&gt;2. Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pour maitriser au mieux le DNS et son utilisation, nous fixons les règles suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aucune machine du réseau interne ne peut accèder à l’internet. Elles utilisent toutes un proxy HTTP pour le web ou un relais SMTP pour la messagerie;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aucune machine ne peut donc résoudre autre chose que le domaine &lt;code&gt;mondomaine.fr&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;Cela permet d’être sûr de pouvoir déployer une politique de sécurité maitrisable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-les-serveurs-dns-et-leur-rôle&#34;&gt;2.1 Les serveurs DNS et leur rôle&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La base pour fixer une politique de résolution est donc de définir un périmètre et des règles d’accès :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Un &lt;strong&gt;serveur DNS cache interne&lt;/strong&gt; assure la résolution de tout type de requête issue d’une machine du réseau interne ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Un &lt;strong&gt;serveur DNS SOA&lt;/strong&gt; assure la gestion du domaine de l’entreprise pour le réseau interne de l’entreprise. Ce serveur ne peut être sollicité que par le serveur de résolution ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Un &lt;strong&gt;serveur DNS cache en DMZ&lt;/strong&gt; assure la résolution des requêtes sur les noms internet issues du serveur DNS cache interne ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Un &lt;strong&gt;serveur DNS SOA externe&lt;/strong&gt; assure la gestion du domaine de l’entreprise pour les macines de l’internet. Ce serveur sera sollicitable par toute machine sur l’internet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/archi-dns/archi.png&#34; alt=&#34;Architecture DNS et rôles de chaque serveur&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Architecture DNS et rôles de chaque serveur&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-résolution-dune-requête-interne-du-domaine-ou-dun-sous-domaine-de-lentreprise&#34;&gt;2.2 Résolution d’une requête interne du domaine ou d’un sous-domaine de l’entreprise&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tout d’abord, le resolver envoie sa requête au serveur DNS référencé dans sa configuration. Ce serveur est un DNS cache qui vérifie que le resolver est habilité à demander des résolutions pour le domaine ou sous-domaine demandé via la mise en place d’ACL sur adresses IP (directive &lt;code&gt;acl&lt;/code&gt;) et de vues (directive &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt;). Le DNS cache ne contient aucune zone mais sait trouver le serveur maître de la zone interrogée (directive &lt;code&gt;forwarders&lt;/code&gt;). Nous utilisons les fonctionnalités de retransmission sélective pour ce type de résolution (définition de zones de type forward et non maître ou esclave). Afin de préserver les serveurs maîtres au mieux des attaques, ceux-ci sont placés dans des DMZ et seuls les serveurs cache sont autorisés à y accéder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;23-résolution-dune-requête-interne-dun-domaine-internet&#34;&gt;2.3 Résolution d’une requête interne d’un domaine Internet&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le resolver interroge le serveur cache référencé. Le serveur cache vérifie que le resolver est habilité à résoudre les domaines inconnus (donc Internet). Le domaine interrogé n’étant pas connu par le serveur cache comme zone faisant l’objet d’une retransmission sélective, le serveur cache retransmet la requête au serveur cache délégué aux résolutions externes que nous avons pris soin de positionner dans une DMZ. Ici aussi, seuls les serveurs cache sont autorisés à y accéder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;En cas d’attaque (via une hypothétique mauvaise implémentation du contrôle d’état UDP sur notre pare-feu par exemple!), l’attaquant n’accédera qu’à un serveur en DMZ uniquement capable de résoudre des requêtes vers Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;24-résolution-dune-requête-externe-du-domaine-de-lentreprise&#34;&gt;2.4 Résolution d’une requête externe du domaine de l’entreprise&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dans ce cas, les requêtes proveniennent d’Internet vers un serveur que nous hébergeons. Bien entendu ce serveur est en DMZ. Étant donné le peu de sûreté que constitue Internet, il ne nous semble pas utile de mettre en place des habilitations pour les résolutions. Nous restreignons les données de notre domaine au strict minimum pour Internet. Le resolver trouve alors sa réponse dans le DNS que nous lui proposons, la requête ne doit jamais entrer dans l’entreprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-serveur-dns-cache-interne&#34;&gt;3. Serveur DNS cache interne&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-attention-au-poste-de-travail&#34;&gt;3.1 Attention au poste de travail !&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comme nous le disions en introduction, la corruption de données de résolution est le problème majeur du DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et bien, la première attaque DNS est d’éviter toute requête DNS ! En effet, la résolution de noms dans les systèmes d’exploitation modernes impliquent des composants autres que les serveurs DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Par exemple sous un système Microsoft Windows, le processus de résolution suit les étapes suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vérification si on demande la résolution du propre nom de la machine ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;présence du nom dans le fichier hosts (&lt;code&gt;%Systemroot%\System32\Drives\Etc\hosts&lt;/code&gt;) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;DNS ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;WINS ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;broadcast réseaux ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LMHOSTS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ainsi, si vous modifier le contenu du fichier hosts, la chaîne de résolution DNS est corrompue. Toute la politique de sécurité DNS est déjà réduite à néant !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cette méthode est utilisée par exemple par les vers de la lignée MYTOB &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; qui font ainsi pointer des sites de type &lt;code&gt;symantec.com&lt;/code&gt; ou &lt;code&gt;update.symantec.com&lt;/code&gt; vers &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; et empêcher ainsi toute mise à jour de l’antivirus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La solution est donc de s’assurer que les utilisateurs n’ont pas les droits administrateur et donc ne peuvent exécuter de processus pouvant modifier le fichier hosts. Idem pour ce qui est de l’accès aux paramètres DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-configuration-du-serveur-dns-cache-interne&#34;&gt;3.2 Configuration du serveur DNS cache interne&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Une fois que le poste client nous semble correctement configuré, voyons la configuration du serveur de cache interne. Dans notre exemple, les machines du réseau interne sont dans le réseau &lt;code&gt;10.1.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt; et le serveur cache interne a l’adresse &lt;code&gt;10.1.255.4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Les vues sous Bind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nos besoins nous conduiront dans le paragraphe suivant à vouloir faire varier les résultats des requêtes en fonction du type de client (ici PC normaux et machines proxies/pivots). Or, Bind nous donne le moyen de réaliser cela : les vues. Une vue est une configuration de Bind pour répondre à certains clients certains résultats grâce aux instructions suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;acl&lt;/code&gt; : permet de définir sous un nom un jeu de clients (adresses IP);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; : définit une configuration complète pour un type de client;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;match-clients&lt;/code&gt; : instruction indiquant les clients à qui s’adressent une vue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/archi-dns/vues.png&#34; alt=&#34;Principes des vues DNS&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Principes des vues DNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Au chapitre 2, nous avons défini différents types de clients au sein du réseau interne (machines standards et machines passerelles). Ces différents types de clients vont se traduire par 2 ACLs différentes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; tous les fichiers de configuration sont disponibles sur le site &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34; data-lang=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// ENTETE DU FICHIER NAMED.CONF du DNS CACHE INTERNE&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Definition des différents types de clients&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// les proxies&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;acl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;passerelles&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10.1.255.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// les machines du reseau interne de l entreprise&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;acl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;reseaulocal&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10.1.0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// le DNS cache en DMZ&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;acl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;dns-cache-internet&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10.255.1.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// le DNS soa interne&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;acl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;dns-soa&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10.255.2.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// localisation des fichiers de configuration&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/var/named&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;; &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;unavailable&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;; };&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;À ces 2 types de clients vont correspondre 2 types de vues qui fourniront 2 types de résolution .

les zones de type forward ont été introduites en version 9.1.x de Bind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&#xA;    class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.brocas.org/assets/articles/archi-dns/resolution-dns-poste-client.png&#34; alt=&#34;Resolution poste&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Resolution poste&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cette configuration ne permet de résoudre que des noms dans le domaine &lt;code&gt;mondomaine.fr&lt;/code&gt;. Les autres noms de domaines ne sont résolus que pour les machines passerelles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cette mesure combinée à la fermeture de tous les ports réseaux (comme HTTP/S ou SMTP) pour les machines du LAN au niveau du firewall empêche toute capacité d’évasion par tunnel DNS autonome. Pour que l’évasion soit désormais possible, il faut que l’attaquant dispose du code d’authentification de l’utilisateur sur le proxy applicatif ce qui limite grandement la menace des attaques automatisées. Et nous sortons là du périmètre de la sécurisation du DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-mise-en-sûreté-des-informations&#34;&gt;4.1 Mise en sûreté des informations&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Les informations contenues dans le DNS SOA interne font de ce DNS le coeur de notre système. En effet, il est le seul à contenir les données de résolution et doit à ce titre être le plus protégé. Ce DNS est placé derrière un pare-feu voire un IPS implémentant un contrôle d’état sur UDP performant. Des règles de sécurité sont mises en place pour n’autoriser que les DNS cache interne à interroger notre DNS SOA interne. Ces règles sont mises en place sur l’équipement de sécurité réseau et dans la configuration du DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ces restrictions limitent les risques de déni de services sur notre DNS SOA interne, le nombre de clients simultanés étant limité par le nombre de DNS cache.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-les-mises-à-jour-dynamiques&#34;&gt;4.2 Les mises à jour dynamiques&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certaines applications de l’entreprise peuvent nécessiter la mise en place des mises à jour dynamiques (serveur DHCP, contrôleur de domaine, etc.) sur notre DNS SOA. Dans ce cas, il est intéressant de créer des sous-domaines particuliers pour ces applications, celles-ci ne peuvent alors pas tout modifier dans notre DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Par exemple, on peut créer le sous-domaine dhcp.mondomaine.fr sur notre DNS et autoriser le serveur DHCP à y effectuer ses mises à jour sans lui donner de droits sur mondomaine.fr. L’option &lt;code&gt;update-policy&lt;/code&gt; permet de plus de limiter les opérations possibles sur la zone. Ainsi, nous pouvons n’autoriser le serveur DHCP à ne modifier que les enregistrements de type A, garantissant ainsi l’impossibilité de modification nos enregistrements de type NS par exemple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;L’utilisation de clef TSIG est également une sécurité à mettre en oeuvre autant que possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;43-création-dune-clef-pour-mises-à-jour-dynamiques&#34;&gt;4.3 Création d’une clef pour mises à jour dynamiques&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous commençons par mettre en place des clefs TSIG pour les serveurs utilisant les mises à jour dynamiques et acceptant d’utiliser ce type de clefs. Nous générerons notre clef avec l’outil dnssec-keygen. Prenons par exemple la mise en place d’une clef pour notre serveur DHCP: &lt;code&gt;dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n HOST dhcp.mondomaine.fr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explication des options :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;L’option &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; permet de choisir l’algorithme utilisé par la clef (ici HMAC-MD5) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;L’option &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; est la longueur de la clef (ici 512 bits) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;L’option &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; spécifie le type de clef créé (dans notre cas, il s’agit d’une clef de type HOST) ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Le dernier paramètre est le nom de la clef.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nous obtenons deux fichiers du type &lt;code&gt;Kdhcp.mondomaine.fr.+157+55315.key&lt;/code&gt; et &lt;code&gt;Kdhcp.mondomaine.fr.+157+55315.private&lt;/code&gt; contenant chacun la clef. En effet, dans notre cas ces deux fichiers sont identiques. Les noms de ces fichiers sont toujours formés par la lettre K majuscule, suivie du nom de la clef, puis de l’identifiant de l’algorithme utilisé et un identifiant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le fichier en &lt;code&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt; contient notre clef sous la forme:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34; data-lang=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;dhcp&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mondomaine&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fr&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;512&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;157&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;S5m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;161i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Ltk6Y7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;nK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;jpV1fll2AHLxN8SqVeZqzxQyg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;L1187PbT5wO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;pteHcN4NdwO59t2TYZkpsbUocMv1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;et le fichier &lt;code&gt;.private&lt;/code&gt; contient cette même clef mais sous la forme:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34; data-lang=&#34;go&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;.2&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;157&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;HMAC_MD5&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;S5m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;161i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Ltk6Y7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;nK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;jpV1fll2AHLxN8SqVeZqzxQyg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;L1187PbT5wOpteHcN4NdwO59t2TYZkpsbUocMv1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour nos besoins, nous créons un nouveau fichier ne contenant que la clef.

Mais, en fait, en fonction de la taille de la réponse, tcp peut être obligatoire même pour les requêtes simples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-serveur-dns-soa-externe&#34;&gt;6. Serveur DNS SOA externe&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Le serveur DNS Internet est celui le plus exposé en considérant le danger extérieur (nous ne reviendrons pas sur ce vaste sujet&amp;hellip;). Il est donc important de bien lui appliquer les règles de sécurité appliquées à tout serveur disponible sur Internet. Au niveau de la configuration DNS, elle est très simple.

   &lt;figcaption&gt;Résolution depuis Internet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note :&lt;/strong&gt; Nous pouvons fusionner physiquement les 2 serveurs DNS Internet (le cache et le serveur DNS internet). La configuration utiliserait alors le principe des vues en fonction de l’adresse appelante comme nous l’avons vu en chapitre 3 pour la configuration du DNS cache interne.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-les-logs&#34;&gt;7. Les logs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Par défaut, le démon named envoie tous ses messages au syslog de la machine qui peut aussi recevoir les messages des autres démons du système. Le manque de lisibilité d’un tel syslog nuit de manière à la sécurité du DNS en gênant sa supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heureusement, il est possible de configurer les logs de named via des canaux de logs afin de, dans notre cas, rediriger certains types de messages dans des fichiers spécifiques. Named peut utiliser plusieurs canaux de logs en parallèle traitant les mêmes informations ou non. Dans notre exemple, nous utilisons deux canaux de logs, un premier pour les messages concernant les problèmes de sécurité et les transferts de zone et un second pour les autres messages et les transferts de zone (messages par défaut).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ces lignes de configuration sont à placer dans les fichiers &lt;code&gt;/etc/named.conf&lt;/code&gt; de tous les DNS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;

denied&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ces deux messages ont les significations suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Le premier est une interdiction d’interrogation ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Le second est une interdiction de transfert de zone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-conclusion&#34;&gt;8. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comme nous avons pu le voir, la sécurisation du DNS passe avant tout par le fait de se poser les bonnes questions sur son utilisation : qui l’utilise ? pour quels types de résolution ? est-ce légitime ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La réponse à ces questions sous l’angle de la sécurité nous a permis d’arriver aux solutions suivantes :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une séparation des différents services DNS (résolution internet vs résolution du domaine interne) par spécialisation des serveurs ;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;une politique centralisée et maîtrisée d’accès à l’internet limitant le spectre de clients pouvant solliciter et donc potentiellement exploiter le DNS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Une amélioration supplémentaire pourrait être l’utilisation de DNSSEC &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; pour le contrôle d’intégrité et l’authentification des demandes de résolutions de noms et les réponses associées. Cette utilisation serait à implémenter au niveau du DNS SOA internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Références :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[BIND] Page d’accueil de BIND,&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[TUN] VUILLARD, V.
